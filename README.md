# Digital Image Processing
This repository is dedicated to implementing image processing algorithms using C++ and the CImg Library. 

## Introduction
I relied on OpenCV for my image processing needs. Though powerful, setting it up on a new machine was always cumbersome, requiring complex installation and linking processes. Plus, OpenCV's extensive set of features often felt overwhelming, making it difficult to manage and understand specific algorithm implementations.

That's when I discovered CImg—a refreshingly simple library that encapsulates everything into **a single header file**. This approach means I can copy the header into my project and start using it immediately, without the hassle. Ｔhis repository will document my journey and the insights I gain along the way. See my [study notes](https://tonyfu97.github.io/Digital-Image-Processing/) for more details.
