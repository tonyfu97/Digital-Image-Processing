# Digital Image Processing
This repository is dedicated to studying image processing algorithms using C++ and the CImg Library. 

## Introduction
I used to rely on OpenCV for image processing tasks. It's powerful, but getting it set up on a new computer was always a bit of a headache. Plus, it has so many features that it was hard to keep track of everything.

Then I found CImg. What's cool about it is that it's all in one header file. That means you can just drop it into your project and get going. I'll be sharing what I learn as I go along, so check out my [study notes](https://tonyfu97.github.io/Digital-Image-Processing/) if you're interested.
