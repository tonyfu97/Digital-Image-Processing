## 1. Installing XQuartz (X11 on macOS)

Yes, I lied. I said you only need to include the `CImg.h` header file to get started. But that's not entirely true. You also need to install the `X11` library, which is used to display images.

The `X11` library is used to display images. It is an open-source effort to develop a version of the X.Org X Window System that runs on macOS. You can download the latest version of XQuartz [here](https://www.xquartz.org). Follow the instructions to install it on your machine.

Because `X11` is often installs in a non-standard location (/opt/X11). This means that the compiler and linker may not automatically look in this location when trying to find the X11 libraries and include files. So, we need to modified the `~/.zshrc` file (or whatever shell you're using) to add the following lines:

```bash
# XQuartz (for CImg)
export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/X11/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
export CPATH=/opt/X11/include:$CPATH
```
This effectively includes the `X11` library in the compiler's search path. Don't forget to restart the shell or execute `source ~/.zshrc` to apply the changes to the current shell.

## 2. Installing the PNG Library

If you want to read and save images in .png format, as demonstrated in the upcoming example, you'll need to install the `libpng` library. You can install it using Homebrew with the following command:

```bash
brew install libpng
```

You won't need to modify any environment variables for `libpng`. When you install `libpng` using Homebrew (or another standard package manager), it places the library and include files in standard locations that the compiler and linker already recognize.

## 3. First Program

To display an image using the CImg library, include the `CImg.h` header file and use the `CImgDisplay` class. Here's a simple example `first_code.cpp`:

```cpp
#define cimg_use_png
#include "CImg.h"
using namespace cimg_library;

int main()
{
    CImg<unsigned char> img("../images/lighthouse.png");
    img.display("Lighthouse");

    return 0;
}
```

The `CImg` class is a template class that represents an image. The template parameter specifies the type of the image pixels. In this case, the image is a color image with unsigned 8-bit integer pixels. The `CImg` class has a constructor that takes a filename as input and loads the image from the file. The `display()` method of the `CImg` class displays the image in a window. The first argument is the title of the window.

Here the macro `cimg_use_png` is used to specify that the `libpng` library should be used to read and write images in .png format. This gives us a peak into how we can customize the CImg library to suit our needs.

To compile the program, you need to link the `X11` and `png` library. Here is the command I used:

```bash
g++ -o first_code first_code.cpp -lX11 -lpthread -lpng
```

The `-lpthread` option links the `pthread` library. The `pthread` library is used to create threads, which is needed by the `CImg` library.

To run the program, do the following:

```bash
./first_code
```

## 4. Visual Studio Code Configuration

If you're coding inside Visual Studio Code like I am, you might see a red squiggly line under `#include "CImg.h"`, accompanied by the complaint `Cannot open source file "X11/Xlib.h" (dependency of "CImg.h")`. Here's how to fix this issue:

1. Open the Command Palette by pressing `Cmd+Shift+P` on a Mac or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux.
   
2. Type "C/C++" in the Command Palette, and then select "Edit Configurations (JSON)" from the dropdown list. This action will open the `c_cpp_properties.json` file directly.

3. Add the following line to the `includePath` array:

```json
"includePath": [
    "${workspaceFolder}/**",
    "/opt/X11/include/**"  // Add this line
],
```

4. Save the file. The red squiggly line should now disappear.

## 5. `CImg` Template Class

The `CImg` library is a template-based image manipulation library, and its template argument specifies the pixel type. By default, if you don't specify the template argument, it's instantiated with `float`.

So when you declare an image like this:

```cpp
CImg<> img("image.png");
```

It is equivalent to:

```cpp
CImg<float> img("image.png");
```

You can specify a different type if you want, such as `unsigned char`, `int`, etc. But if you simply use `CImg<>`, then it defaults to using `float`.

## 6. Reading Command-Line Parameters

The `cimg_usage()` and `cimg_option()` functions are used to handle command-line arguments. Here's a brief description of each function:

1. **`cimg_usage(const char *const format, ...)`:** This function is typically used to print a description of your program when it's invoked from the command line.

2. **`cimg_option(const char *const opt, type_def variable, const char *const format, ...)`:** This function is a command-line option parser. It's used to handle options passed to your program when it's invoked from the command line. Here's a breakdown of the parameters:
   - `opt`: the name of the command-line option.
   - `variable`:  the default value that will be assigned to the variable if the corresponding command-line option is not provided.
   - `format`: a string that may contain a description of what the option does (this will be printed if a specific help option is invoked, like `--help`).

Here's a simple example showing how you might use these functions:

```cpp
#include "CImg.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    cimg_usage("My simple program that does XYZ.");
    int my_option1 = cimg_option("-o1", 0, "An optional parameter that affects behavior.");
    int my_option2 = cimg_option("-o2", 99, "Another optional parameter that affects behavior.");
    // Rest of the program
}
```

If the user runs the program with the options, like `./my_program -o1 5`, the `my_option1` variable will be set to `5`, and the `my_option2` variable will be set to the default value of `99`.

If they run the program with the `--help` option, they will see the usage string followed by the options descriptions.

## 7. Get vs. Non-Get Methods in Image Processing with CImg

In image processing using CImg, it's really helpful to know whether a method is going to give you a new object (a get method) or change the one you already have (a non-get method). CImg has both types for most of its methods:

* **Get Methods**: These create a new object with the changes you want, leaving the one you started with the same. Like `CImg<float>::get_blur()`, which makes a new blurred image but doesn't touch the original.
* **Non-get Methods**: These change the object you call them on and usually give you back a reference to that changed object. For example, `CImg<float>::blur()` changes the image and gives you back a reference to it.

Here's an example to show how this works:

```cpp
CImg<> lum = img.get_norm().blur(sigma).normalize(0, 255);
```

In this code, `get_norm` makes a new image (make it gray-scale by taking the L2-norm of the RGB channel), and `blur` and `normalize` change it and give you back references. This way of doing things makes it easy to chain operations together and save memory.

**Resutls:**

* Original Image
<p align="center">
<img src="../images/lighthouse.png" alt="lighthouse original" width="400">
</p>

* After `get_norm()`, `blur()`, and `normalize()`
<p align="center">
<img src="results/lighthouse_lum.png" alt="lighthouse lum" width="400">
</p>
