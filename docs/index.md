# Digital Image Processing with C++ : Study Notes

This website includes my study notes for the book [*Digital Image Processing with C++: Implementing Reference Algorithms with the CImg Library*](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Image-Processing-Implementing-Algorithms/dp/1032347538) by Tschumperlé, Tilmant, and Barra.

Please note that this website does not include the book's content, except for the code snippets used. If you're interested in more details, you can purchase the book [here](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Image-Processing-Implementing-Algorithms/dp/1032347538). I am not affiliated with the authors or the publisher in any way. I simply enjoy the book and want to share my notes with others. While I have some background in image processing, I have attempted to make my notes beginner-friendly. I have included things that I personally found to need more explanation or clarification. I hope you find them useful.

## Introduction
I relied on OpenCV for my image processing needs. Though powerful, setting it up on a new machine was always cumbersome, requiring complex installation and linking processes. Plus, OpenCV's extensive set of features often felt overwhelming, making it difficult to manage and understand specific algorithm implementations.

That's when I discovered CImg—a refreshingly simple library that encapsulates everything into **a single header file**. This approach means I can copy the header into my project and start using it immediately, without the hassle. I have also always wanted to learn more about the inner workings and design patterns of image processing libraries. CImg's simplicity makes it a great candidate for this purpose. This [repository](https://github.com/tonyfu97/Digital-Image-Processing) will document my journey and the insights I gain along the way.
